## Coding standards

### 1.	General standards: 
•	Use const and let instead of var.
•	Create reusable functions which are frequently used across application.
•	Maintain file length, it should be too lengthy, instead create chunk of functions to be called.
•	Use maximum utility of ES6.
•	Use sanitary to check for API health.
•	Always write tests for your code.
•	Create README.md file and put required information to run your project.


### 2.	Naming convention:
•	Use same naming convention across whole project. Like camel case for file name and function name, variable name could be camel case or snake case. (use same for all variable)
•	Variable & function name should be self descriptive.


### 3.	GIT: 
•	Create separate branch based on modules and push code regularly.(DO NOT COMMIT TO MASTER DIRECTLY)
•	Always take pull before pushing code and creating PR.


### 4.	Package:
•	Use standard third party library which provides regular updates and is not deprecated.


### 5.	Imports:
•	Third party package should be first in import, then files or function to import.


### 6.	Documentation:
•	Create API documentation dynamically using swagger or any other library.
